## **ðŸ’¸ CAPITALISM IS BROKEN ðŸ’¸**

> If I were asked to answer the following question: What is slavery? and I should answer in one word, It is murder!, my meaning would be understood at once. No extended argument would be required to show that the power to remove a man's mind, will, and personality, is the power of life and death, and that it makes a man a slave. It is murder. Why, then, to this other question: What is property? may I not likewise answer, It is robbery!, without the certainty of being misunderstood; the second proposition being no other than a transformation of the first?
_â€”â€‰Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, What is Property?_

I believe that all powers should serve the common good.
That includes the _economic_ power.

The industrial era's **extinction** of species can largely be faulted on **Greed**.

> _**Know your sins.**_

You should hurry and take back political power before it's too late.
Become constituent!  You can do it!  I _know_ you can.
