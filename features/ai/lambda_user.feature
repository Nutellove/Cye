Feature: Reacting to a question written by a lambda user
  In order to make the lambda user give up the keyboard to an initated user
  As an AI
  I must answer vaguely or not at all and make it difficult and tedious for him to ask questions

  # MWAIS... c'est pas encore ça... mais j'aime bien la définition de la feature

#  Background:
#    Given I am a lambda user # AI's determination of user role will be described in another feature
#    And I am on the question page
#
#  Scenario: Asking a Question
#    Given I type "What is my name ?" as a question
#    When I submit the question
#    Then I should see a generic response
